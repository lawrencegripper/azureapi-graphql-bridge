# Azure API GraphQL Wrapper

Just have a bit of play with wrapping azures APIs into a graphql endpoint using the public swagger docs. 

## Status: Less than alpha (a toy)

It does currently build an endpoint but calls through it will fail. 

## Running

1. Git clone
2. npm install
3. npm run
4. hit localhost:3000/voyager or localhost:3000/graphql
